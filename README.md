Hi,

I have some example C++ codes which I wrote while reading Larry Nyhoff's "[ADTs, Data Structures and Problem Solving with C++](http://www.amazon.com/ADTs-Structures-Problem-Solving-Edition/dp/0131409093/)". There are more little code laying around my harddisk but I'm sharing the ones which makes some sense. Please note that though I was familiar with OOP and C, I wrote these as a beginner in C++ and STL. So the code included may not be elegant or efficient.

I'm uploading only an inferior shortest path algorithm which does depth-first search by using a stack.

I figured out it was far easier using graphs and breadth-first search when I read the chapter on graphs. Even source code for the algorithm is included in the book. So I wrote a similar implementation. I hope to upload it today after fixing the comments.

There is also one othe piece of code which uses the same map.h file and a BST template. I will try to take a look at them and upload those two too.
